# Paper Summary: Genetic Algorithm for Shortest Vector Problem

This repository contains the implementation and experimental results of a genetic algorithm designed to solve the Shortest Vector Problem (SVP) in lattices. The paper explores the application of genetic algorithms, local search, and heuristic pruning techniques to efficiently find the shortest non-zero vector in a lattice.

### Prerequisites


To understand and work with the concepts presented in the paper on the Genetic Algorithm for the Shortest Vector Problem, it is recommended to have a basic understanding of the following:

- **Lattice Theory**: Familiarity with the fundamentals of lattices, lattice basis reduction, and lattice problems such as the Shortest Vector Problem (SVP) and Closest Vector Problem (CVP).

- **Genetic Algorithms**: Knowledge of genetic algorithm principles, including population-based optimization, selection mechanisms, crossover, and mutation operators.

- **Markov Chains**: Understanding of Markov chains and their application in modeling stochastic processes, particularly in the context of genetic algorithms.

- **Mathematical Optimization**: Basic knowledge of optimization techniques, search algorithms, and convergence analysis in the context of combinatorial optimization problems.
